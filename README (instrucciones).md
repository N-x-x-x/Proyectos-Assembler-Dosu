# Dosu! 
An assembly x86 game.


## 🕹️ Game Description: **Dosu!**

**Dosu!** is a fast-paced reflex game inspired by **OSU**, designed to test your coordination and reaction speed.

### 🎯 Objective
Click on the correct squares as they appear on the screen to score points. Each square has a limited lifetime — if it disappears before being clicked (or if clicked incorrectly), you’ll lose a life.

- You start the game with **3 lives**.
- If you lose all lives, the game is over.
- Multiple squares can appear at the same time.

### 🟩 Square Types and Mechanics

- 🟢 **Green Squares**: Click them using the **left mouse button**.
- 🔵 **Blue Squares**: Click them using the **right mouse button**.
- 🔴 **Red Squares**: **Do not click**. If you do, you lose a life — just ignore them.

## 💻 How to Run the Game

To run **Dosu!**, you'll need to use **DOSBox**, a DOS emulator that allows you to run older DOS-based games on modern systems.

##  What I Learned

While developing **Dosu!** using **x86 Assembly**, I gained hands-on experience with several important low-level programming concepts:

- **Memory management:** I learned how to work directly with memory addresses, segment registers, and stack operations.
- **Timing and delays:** I implemented precise timing control using interrupts and loops to manage the lifetime of each square.
- **Low-level logic and control flow:** Building game mechanics with conditionals, loops, and direct input/output required careful thinking and debugging.
- **Direct hardware interaction:** I worked with interrupts for keyboard and mouse input, screen rendering, and real-time gameplay feedback.
- **Optimizing code and thinking efficiently:** Since every instruction counts in Assembly, I developed an appreciation for writing optimized, clean, and efficient code.

This project gave me a strong foundation in how computers actually operate under the hood, and it strengthened my ability to think algorithmically at a very granular level.
